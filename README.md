Welcome to Captain Veggie!
Time to harvest your veggies before the rascally rabbits get to them!

Here's how to play:

The game uses data from VeggieFile1.csv and VeggieFile2.csv to configure vegetables and other settings. Feel free to modify these files to customize your experience!
Your goal is to collect as many vegetables as possible before the rabbits devour them all.
Each veggie is worth points, adding to your overall score.
Catch a mischievous rabbit and watch your points soar!
Rabbits spawn every 5 ticks, with a maximum of 5 hopping around at any given time.
Are you ready, Captain Veggie? Let's save the harvest!
